# Echo Chat UI/UX Improvement PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the critical UI/UX improvements needed for the Echo Chat application to enhance user experience and functionality.

## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. Message Display - Markdown Rendering
**Issue**: Messages received from LLM are in Markdown format but displayed as raw text instead of rendered Markdown.

**Solution**: 
- Implement Markdown rendering component to properly display formatted messages
- Support for common Markdown elements (headers, bold, italic, code blocks, lists, links)
- Maintain consistent styling with the overall chat interface

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Critical for message readability and user experience

### 2. Chat Input Text Visibility
**Issue**: Text in chat input field appears gray and is difficult to see while typing.

**Solution**:
- Update input field text color to high contrast (black/white depending on theme)
- Ensure placeholder text remains distinguishable from actual input
- Test visibility in different lighting conditions

**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: Essential for basic chat functionality

### 3. Streaming LLM Response Display
**Issue**: LLM responses appear all at once instead of streaming in real-time.

**Solution**:
- Implement streaming text display for LLM responses
- Show typing indicator or cursor during response generation
- Smooth character-by-character or word-by-word rendering
- Maintain scroll position during streaming

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Enhanced user engagement and perceived responsiveness

### 4. Voice-to-Text Copy Functionality
**Issue**: No way to easily copy the current meeting voice content.

**Solution**:
- Add copy button next to voice-to-text display area
- One-click copy of entire meeting transcript
- Visual feedback on successful copy action
- Consider additional options like copy selection or copy timestamps

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Improved workflow for meeting note-taking

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Fix critical UI issues (Message rendering, Input visibility)
2. **Phase 2**: Add streaming functionality and copy features
3. **Phase 3**: Testing and refinement

## Success Metrics
- Messages display properly formatted Markdown
- Input text is clearly visible during typing
- LLM responses stream smoothly in real-time
- Copy functionality works reliably
- Overall user satisfaction improvement

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend framework compatibility
